# SolveThis - Crowdsourced Problem Solving & Innovation Marketplace

## Overview

SolveThis is a high-impact problem-solving platform designed to bridge the gap between real-world challenges and capable solution creators. Individuals, organizations, and research groups can post problems—ranging from business bottlenecks and technical challenges to community issues—and optionally attach a bounty (monetary value) for the best solution. Solvers can respond with prototypes, MVPs, designs, or documented proposals. Verified experts gain visibility through their profiles, which showcase successfully solved problems and implemented solutions.

Unlike typical freelancing or idea-sharing platforms, SolveThis emphasizes authenticity, depth, and defensibility—building a trusted ecosystem where verified problem owners and solvers interact transparently, securely, and with measurable accountability.
